# Help Wanted #
Do you want to join us in this effort? We are welcoming your [feedback](http://goalgorilla.github.io/drupal_social/prototype.html), (development) time and/or financial support. For feedback we will use [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/social) for other questions or suggestions please contact taco@goalgorilla.com.

Source-code and installation instructions are currently only available on [Github.com](https://github.com/goalgorilla/drupal_social). You are welcome to try the installation profile yourself although it is still work-in-progress. The coming months we will continue to work on the theme to match the [prototype](http://goalgorilla.github.io/drupal_social/prototype.html). If you find any issues feel free to file a bug report in the issue queue.

# Installation #

## Docker toolbox ##
Download and install the [toolbox](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox).

Note that the docker projects have to be somewhere in your /Users/ directory in order to work (limitation for Mac and Windows). Note that /Users/<name>/Sites/Docker is fine.


## Steps ##

1. Start a docker machine (docker quickstart icon).

2. Clone this repository to the directory of your choice (e.g. ~/Sites/social).

3. Go inside the folder in which you cloned this repository (where the docker-compose.yml file is).

4. Build and start the docker containers.
    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This will build multiple containers (see the Dockerfile in docker_build/drupal8) and all the dependencies.

5. Add social.dev and mailcatcher.social.dev to your /etc/hosts file based on the ip of the docker machine.

    If necessary you can find the IP with this command on your host machine:
    ```
    docker-machine ls
    ```

6. Run the install script on the docker web container, the name could be slightly different on your machine, in the example below the name is social_web_1.
    ```
    docker exec -it social_web_1 bash /root/dev-scripts/install/install_script.sh
    ```

7. Add the proxy container.
    ```
    docker run -d -p 80:80 --name=proxy -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro jwilder/nginx-proxy
    ```

## Usage ##

**If you want to see which containers are running:**
```
docker ps
```

**SSH into the container:**
```
docker exec -it social_web_1 bash
```
Here you can use _drush_ and _drupal list_.

**If you want to re-install, execute these commands in the social_web_1 container:**
```
drush sql-drop -y;
rm -f sites/default/settings.php
rm -f sites/default/settings.local.php
rm -rf sites/default/files
```

**If you want to start the proxy:**
```
docker start proxy
```

**Now run the install script on your host machine again.**
```
docker exec -it social_web_1 bash /root/dev-scripts/install/install_script.sh
```

**To view emails go to:**
```
mailcatcher.social.dev
```
